10 years from now….have own place…be happier than today….be wherever life takes me

Living in the moment so hard to say where I’ll be in 10 years

The last five years have produced enormous positive change for me — internally i might be very different but externally i have not changed much.

It might be the same 10 years from now, or completely different.

Maybe I will have a lot of friends.

Coding Dojo classmates

In 5 years: made friends at work, living well, may or may not be married  Maybe 1 or 2 more notches up in the development hierarchy. Most likely working at a big company, small chance I will have a start-up

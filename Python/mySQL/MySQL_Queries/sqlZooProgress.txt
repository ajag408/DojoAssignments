Working on self-join number 10

JOIN route AS b
ON a.num = b.num
JOIN stops AS stopb
ON b.stop = stopb.id

 AND b.num IN  AND (stopa.name = stopb.name)


((a.num IN (SELECT num FROM route JOIN stops ON route.stop = stops.id WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart') OR b.num IN (SELECT num FROM route JOIN stops ON route.stop = stops.id WHERE name = 'Sighthill') AND a.num != b.num) 


JOIN route AS b
ON a.num = b.num
JOIN stops AS stopb
ON b.stop = stopb.id

a.num IN (SELECT num FROM route JOIN stops ON route.stop = stops.id WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart') OR b.num IN (SELECT num FROM route JOIN stops ON route.stop = stops.id WHERE name = 'Sighthill')



Query 1
SELECT a.num, a.company
FROM route AS a
JOIN stops AS stopa
ON a.stop = stopa.id
WHERE a.stop = 53

Query2
SELECT b.num, b.company
FROM route AS b
WHERE b.stop = 213
